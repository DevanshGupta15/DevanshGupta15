🙋‍♂️ Hey there!
I'm Devansh, a Btech student and a lover of all things tech. 🤖 I'm passionate about creating creative and out-of-the-box solutions for real-world problems. I firmly believe that technology has the power to change the world for the better. 🚀

When it comes to coding, I'm a wizard in Machine Learning. I've worked on some pretty cool projects in the past.

In my free time, I love to invest my time in gym and having a fit life. I'm a constant learner and I'm always exploring new technologies and concepts. You know what they say, "You can never have too much knowledge." 🤓. 

💰 Finance Enthusiast Alert!
I'm a finance junkie. I spend my free time reading articles and blogs about the latest trends and developments in finance. 📚 I'm always looking for new ways to deepen my knowledge and understanding of the financial world.

Don't be shy, say hi! 🙌

Thanks for stopping by my GitHub profile! Let's build something amazing together. 🔨
